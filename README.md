# Penang Rainfall Prediction
## WMU102-Makers

### Overview

In this project, we have trained and built a model to predict the rainfall intensity in Penang.

The features used to train the model includes:
* date (year, month, day)
* the maximum, minimum and average values of: temperature, dew point, humidity and wind speed

The notebook consists of the following sections:
1. Introduction
2. Dataset
3. Data Preprocessing and Preparation
4. Proposed Solution
5. Conclusion

### Dataset

The dataset ```penang-rainfall-dataset.csv``` can be downloaded.

In the notebook, the url of the dataset raw file in GitHub is specified.

Therefore, you may run the notebook without downloding the dataset.

### Model

The Gradient Boosting model ```model_pkl``` is exported from the Colab Notebook.

You may download it to deploy in your own application.

### Web Application with Model Deployed
